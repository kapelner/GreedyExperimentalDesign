Description: Computes experimental designs for a
    two-arm experiment with covariates via a number of methods. The first
    is by greedily optimizing a
    balance objective function via pairwise switching. This optimization 
    provides lower variance for the treatment effect estimator (and higher 
    power) while preserving a design that is close to complete randomization.
    We return all iterations of the designs for use in a permutation test.
    The second is via numerial optimization 
    (via Gurobi which must be installed) a la Bertsimas and Kallus. 
    Then we include a few more: Morgan & Rubin's rerandomization, 
    Karp's method for one covariate, 
    exhaustive enumeration to find the 
    optimal solution (only for small sample sizes) and of course
    complete randomization and randomization with forced-balance.
    We also allow for three objective functions:
    Mahalanobis distance,
    Sum of absolute differences standardized and
    Kernel distances via the kernlab library.
